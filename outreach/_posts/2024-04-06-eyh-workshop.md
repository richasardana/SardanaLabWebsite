Apr, 2024: Sardana lab participated in the 'Expand your horizons' community outreach program at Cornell to encourage girls to pursue STEM careers. We organized three hands-on workshops for 7th/ 8th grade Ithaca high school girls on the priciples of microscopy. All the participants built a simple microscope and observed a diversity of interesting specimens.
