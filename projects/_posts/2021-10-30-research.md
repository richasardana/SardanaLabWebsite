We study how **membrane protein trafficking** and **quality control mechanisms** surveil the membrane proteome, and how their **dysregulation** results in **human disease**. 


Our research studies **how membrane proteins are classified** as functional or non-functional by cellular protein quality control mechanisms:
- How do cellular QC mechanisms make these decisions? 
- What features of the proteins are recognized? 
- What features of the QC machinery provide them the ability to make the distinction?

We are also interested in understanding **how integral membrane proteins are correctly maintained** at specific intracellular organelles:
- How are specific proteins selectively packaged for sorting? 
- What are the consequences of defects in these pathways?

A better understanding of these processes is especially relevant for **designing therapeutic interventions for pathological conditions** where membrane proteins are mis-sorted to the wrong cellular location or when damaged proteins are not efficiently removed resulting in accumulation of protein aggregates inside the cells.
