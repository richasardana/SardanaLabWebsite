</ul>

<p>Meetings will be listed on the lab calendar. 
Meetings won’t take place over holidays or when they clash with other events, like conferences that multiple people in the lab are involved in. 
We sometimes take “weeks off” meetings, to give everyone a much-needed break.</p>

<p>Meetings are in person where preferable, although it is usually possible to join by zoom, using the same <a href="https://ed-ac-uk.zoom.us/j/87317539855">lab meeting link</a>. Check the lab calendar or slack for the password.
Please give enough notice (2 hours) ifyou will join a meeting by zoom, so that someone can set it up.</p>

<h1 id="lab-meetings-for-everyone-weekly">Lab meetings for everyone (weekly)</h1>

<p>Lab meetings are the regular opportunity for the whole group to come together to talk about science, and about important logistics.
Lab meetings are a mutually respectful and supportive environment.</p>

<p>Lab meetings can take various formats:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Research update - led by a single lab member, is most common</li>
  <li>One-slide meeting -  everyone presents one slide on their recent work</li>
  <li>Guest presentation from someone outside the lab</li>
  <li>Journal clubs are now separate - one or more lab members lead discussion of a relevant paper</li>
  <li>Other - for example, a “welcome back” meeting, a “write some of the lab manual” meeting, a “state of the lab” annual-ish meeting</li>
</ul>

<p>Whatever the format, the goal of lab meeting is for everyone in the room, including the presenter, to learn things that are useful to their work.</p>

<p>Currently Laura Tuck is organising the lab meeting schedule. Please give Laura at least a week’s notice of any changes to the schedule, as it is much easier to reorganise a meeting at the previous week’s lab meeting rather than later.</p>

<h2 id="timing">Timing</h2>

<p>Lab meetings are <strong>10:30-12:00 Mondays</strong> in Waddington 1.07 (Oct 2021).</p>

<ul>
  <li>10:15 meeting opens, drift in with coffee/tea, chat and discuss lab business</li>
  <li>10:30 prompt, presentation starts</li>
  <li>11:45 latest, show the last slide</li>
  <li>Discuss any other lab business</li>
  <li>12:00, everyone should leave (reminder that ICMB Monday seminars are usually at this time)</li>
</ul>

<p>We previously tried to keep lab meetings to 1 hour, but they ended up closer to 1 and a half. The new timetable seems to work well as long as we are disciplined about starting on time.</p>

<h2 id="giving-a-research-update-lab-meeting">Giving a Research update lab meeting</h2>

<p>The purpose of these lab meetings is to communicate and to exchange useful ideas, not to simply “update”, nor to impress.
This will usually be a talk with slides, with sub-goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Teach the group about your work.</li>
  <li>Articulate what you are thinking about your work’s status and future.</li>
  <li>Solicit feedback and ideas from other lab members, to improve your project(s).</li>
  <li>Practice for talks outside the lab, in a friendly environment.</li>
</ul>

<p>The key point is that the presentation must be accessible to everyone in the lab.
There is always a new student who hasn’t heard about your project before.
There are also people who have heard you talk before, however, they are unlikely to remember those talks clearly, because they are human and also focused on their own project.
The presentation must be accessible to all of them, which requires thoughtful prioritisation of what you choose to present.</p>

<p>Research update presentations should usually:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Give an introduction to your project, highlighting important ideas and objects (e.g. proteins/genes).</li>
  <li>Give each slide a helpful title, ideally a sentence that describes its content.</li>
  <li>Explain how to interpret each kind of data that you present, concisely and clearly. All data and axes need readable labels.</li>
  <li>Include a small number of crucial ideas/results from elsewhere, appropriately referenced.</li>
  <li>Make it clear when the talk shifts to your results; present selected primary data.</li>
  <li>Address problems, uncertainties, and obstacles.</li>
  <li>End with some kind of conclusion and plan for future work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lab members working on a new project will usually present a more in-depth introduction and  plans for future work, not any new data. 
Similarly, it can be important to present incomplete or inconclusive data in lab meetings; sometimes this leads to the most helpful discussions.
A well-thought-out lab meeting will strengthen your future work, by enabling a productive conversation with the group about your ideas and plans.</p>

<p>Aim for a 45-minute talk with at most one slide per minute, to allow time for discussion; a shorter talk is fine. It is a good idea to discuss your plan for lab meeting with the PI at least a week in advance.</p>

<p>Conversely, it is the responsibility of everyone else in the lab meeting to engage with the presenter and the presentation.
Everyone is welcome - indeed, encouraged - to ask questions.
We all bring value to lab meetings, and for each of us there are very many things we don’t know; if one person has a question, it’s likely other people have the same question.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="one-slide-meetings">One-slide meetings</h2>

<p>In brief, everyone presents one slide on their recent work. Guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The slide is an opportunity for scientific feedback and discussion on your work.</li>
  <li>You could present a result (a gel, a figure, an analysis, etc)</li>
  <li>You could present the design for a future or in-progress experiment</li>
  <li>You could present a cartoon or schematic figure to explain a mental model you’re working with</li>
  <li>The slide should have a title that is a sentence summarizing the message of the slide</li>
  <li>5 minutes is not a lot of time to explain lots of things. There is probably only time for one panel of a figure, or a small cartoon schematic followed by a result.</li>
  <li>We don’t care how much you have done (everyone knows you have done a lot) - we all want 5 minutes of interesting scientific discussion.</li>
  <li>Because the group is big, we will be keeping strictly to time and cutting off after 5 minutes. With a 1-minute warning.</li>
  <li>Any questions, ask around.</li>
</ul>

<p>Claus Wilke’s blogpost, <a href="https://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/7/8/share-your-preliminary-work-with-other-people-even-if-you-think-its-crap">share your preliminary work with other people</a>, gives an eloquent perspective.</p>

<h1 id="journal-club-meetings-about-fortnightly">Journal club meetings (about fortnightly)</h1>

<p>From September 2021, we are going to try more regular dedicated journal clubs.
We will try these on Thursdays at 11am “opposite” to the SynthSys OCM Thursdays.
Same lab meeting link, also listed on the lab calendar.</p>

<p>Roughly they work like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We choose a relevant paper, that everyone should read before the meeting. Come prepared to talk about what you learned from the paper and any questions you have.</li>
  <li>The paper can be old, new, or a preprint. The big criteria for choice is that it has to be valuable for us to discuss as a group. Maybe it’s the ideas, maybe the methods, maybe the subject matter.</li>
  <li>Discussion is usually led by one person, and/or can be shared around the group. We don’t need perfect presentations, just some structure for a good discussion.</li>
  <li>It is usually helpful to start with some context about why the paper was written and why you chose the paper / why it’s relevant to us.</li>
  <li>The leader is encouraged to showcase their own data/project or other related information in the light of the main journal club paper. These have been some of the most useful journal club moments.</li>
  <li>Everyone suggests papers for next subgroup meeting, and we decide on one of them. It is ok to suggest a paper that you have already read.</li>
  <li>PI aims to attend all journal clubs, however it’s fine for them to continue even if PI can’t attend.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="subgroup-meetings-are-no-longer-happening">Subgroup meetings are no longer happening</h3>

<p>From January to June 2021 we tried journal clubs in themed subgroups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RNA-binding proteins, Ssd1 and so on - Rosey, Marah, Louis, also Paddy and Yuxuan. 10am alternate Mondays (weeks 1+3 in lab rota).</li>
  <li>3’UTRs - Sam, Weronika. 10am alternate Tuesdays (weeks 1+3 in lab rota).</li>
  <li>Fungal pathogens - Laura, Liz, Rachael. 10am alternate Mondays (weeks 2+4 in lab rota)</li>
  <li>Ribosome profiling has a separate meeting on Wednesday afternoons, see <a href="https://github.com/riboviz/bbsrc-nsf">bbsrc-nsf repository</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>There was a lot of learning that happened, despite the large time commitment and stress of working from home and/or shift system.</p>

<p>Sometimes we tried a different format, for example discussing a manuscript draft or designing a tricky experiment. We aim to announce the subgroup agenda 2 weeks in advance in any case.</p>

<h1 id="1-1-meetings-fortnightly">1-1 meetings (fortnightly)</h1>

<p>Most lab members have 1-1 meetings with the PI, fortnightly, that last 55 minutes.
These guidelines are intended to be “as simple as possible” to make these meetings most pleasant and productive.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The lab member takes notes and sends a summary to PI later on the day of the 1-1 meeting. Notes should begin “1-1 meeting notes [date]”. (By email or slack? To discuss)</li>
  <li>Meeting starts by discussing progress on agreed priorities and action points from previous meeting.</li>
  <li>Meeting includes reviewing lab notebook, or other data/analysis/writing/slides, as appropriate.</li>
  <li>For wet lab workers, the lab notebook (RSpace) should be updated before the 1-1 meeting.</li>
  <li>Meeting ends by agreeing priorities for the lab member for their next fortnight, which go in the notes. Realistically, there will be between 1 and 3 priorities for the next two-week period, because larger numbers of things cannot all be prioritised.</li>
  <li>Notes should include action points for PI (with deadlines), and any questions arising from the meeting that we don’t yet have answers to.</li>
  <li>Notes can be brief; whatever can be written up in 15 minutes is good enough.</li>
</ul>

<p>Why bother with these guidelines and with writing notes?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Guidelines are a <a href="http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/">checklist</a> to make sure we cover the important points.</li>
  <li>Notes act as a “diary” of what we did, which makes it easier.</li>
  <li>It’s pretty easy to misunderstand each other, especially on zoom. Written notes help to clear up those misunderstandings, and especially to clarify what is and is not a priority.</li>
</ul>

<p>Project students should find these guidelines useful to make the most of their meetings with the PI and any co-supervisors, although the meetings may have a different frequency or format.</p>

<h2 id="1-1-meeting-timings">1-1 meeting timings</h2>

<p>New from September 2021, Edward would like to keep 1-1 meetings on Monday/Wednesday/Thursdays to keep Tuesdays and Friday free for extended thinking / experiments / etc.</p>

<p>We will try to schedule 1-1 meetings using the outlook calendar meeting invite service.
Edward will work on making that calendar reflect when he is free and when he is busy.</p>

<h1 id="lab-socials-whenever-we-feel-like-it">Lab socials (whenever we feel like it)</h1>

<p>Guidelines:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organize a lab social when you feel like it.</li>
  <li>Be inclusive.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have an irregular lab coffee 10:30am Fridays.</p>
