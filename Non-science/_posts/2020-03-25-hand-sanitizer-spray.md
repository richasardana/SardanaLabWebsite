**WHO guidelines for local production of hand sanitizer spray**

Cannot find hand sanitizer in the grocery stores because people are hoarding it? Don't panic.  World Health Organization recommends a simple recipe to make your own with three ingredients that you can find in any pharmacy: Ethanol or Isopropyl Alcohol (either works fine), Glycerin, Hydrogen Peroxide.

[See the detailed WHO guidelines here.](https://www.who.int/gpsc/5may/Guide_to_Local_Production.pdf)
This recipe is for a spray sanitizer which can be used to sanitize hands, as well as surfaces.
