# Welcome to the Sardana lab!
{: .no_toc }

This page includes quickstart guides for new lab members. It includes lab values, expectations and responsibilities. Group members are welcome to propose changes, add comments, and work with Richa to update the document.

# Lab values

We can achieve our full potential only if our research environment comprises of a diverse team of people that bring together unique perspectives, experiences, and backgrounds. We will strive to create an environment in which all lab members respect each other, feel comfortable to express themselves, and make contributions.

<a name="communication"></a>

# Communication expectations

Talk to people. Ask questions. Answer questions. Admit when you don't know the answer. Be curious. But be kind and respectful of others. We will likely be more productive in our research if our lab space is a welcoming and happy environment.

Most _internal_ lab day-to-day communication happens on Slack first. When it's helpful to talk to someone "in person" or by call - ask to set it up. All lab member cell phone numbers will be saved on the Lab drive.  

Most _external_ communication happens on email. If you're asking a lab business-related question, if in doubt cc Richa.

Most lab events will be posted on the Sardana lab calendar, and some will be listed on the Slack channel as well.

These are asynchronous communication channels - *you don't need to respond immediately*.
Set notification schedules on Slack so that you aren't disturbed when you're focused on a task or you're off work or asleep, and ignore emails then too. However, *please respond to email & Slack messages within one ordinary working day*, i.e. a weekday when you're not on leave, nor at a conference or training session, nor doing a stressful experiment such as a timecourse. 
If you don't have a full response, it's courteous to respond saying "I don't know, can I get back to you tomorrow/next week/when I've done some reading". 
If you're not working, set an autoreply to do that for you. 
If you ask someone else a question and they don't get back to you, ask again the next ordinary working day.

# Lab access 

The lab is in the [Veterinary Medical Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/930+Campus+Rd,+Ithaca,+NY+14853/@42.4474267,-76.4673541,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89d081f87ed5e193:0x37bbabbf4ca02fc8!8m2!3d42.4474267!4d-76.4651654) in the Department of Molecular Medicine at Cornell University's Ithaca campus. The building requires ID card access after hours, and the lab space and the student office need key access- discuss with Richa if and how to request access permissions for you. 


<a name="planning"></a>

# Lab Presence

It is expected that all lab members will apply a consistent and professional effort to their research, and remain in communication with the broader group. This includes making an honest effort to advance research efforts, attending meetings with Richa, lab meetings, journal clubs and departmental seminars. 

## Lab meetings

Everyone is expected to attend, where possible:

* Lab meetings.
* Scheduled one-on-one meetings with Richa.
* Lab journal club meetings.
* Lab socials.
* DEI group discussions.

<!--For full details, see the [meetings overview lab manual page](meetings-overview). --> 


## Nearby seminars, happy hours, etc.

Attendance is encouraged for: 
* Departmental Journal Club
* Departmental and other relevant seminars
* Departmental happy hours and mixers

# Computing

There are a lot of different online tools, this guide is a starter.

## Cornell NETID 

First you'll need your university email account including a *NETID* and password. You will need your Cornell NETID login to access various softwares and the VPN.

<!--The university's email goes by default to [outlook](https://outlook.office.com/owa/?realm=ed.ac.uk), although it is possible to set up with other clients. 
Outlook has the advantage of interfacing with the outlook calendar system, sharepoint, microsoft teams, and so on.
So, we use it for the lab calendar. -->


## Accounts to create

### Slack - lab talk

[Sardana lab slack workspace](https://sardanalabslack.slack.com/) - this is where most of the lab talk happens. Sign up first so you can ask other questions there.

### Outlook and Google calendar groups

- Request access to the calendar for lab activities, as as well as to sign up for shared departmental equipment. 

### VPN - off-campus access

For many off-campus options you connect through the VPN (virtual private network).

Register for a VPN account using: [information services vpn site](https://it.cornell.edu/cuvpn). 

### Shared data storage space

Please request access to the lab's space, `csce/datastore/biology/groups/wallace_rna` a.k.a. `smb://csce.datastore.ed.ac.uk/csce/biology/groups/wallace_rna`. Edward authorizes access to this datastore storage area. 

#### Mapping datastore drives on your computer

To access datastore drives as if they were on your computer (this needs checking):

1. Click Start > Computer, select Map network drive and choose any available letter. 
2. In the Folder box, type the share's path `\\sg.datastore.ed.ac.uk\csce\biology\groups\wallace_rna` or (windows) `smb://csce.datastore.ed.ac.uk/csce/biology/groups/wallace_rna`
3. Select Reconnect at logon and Connect using different credentials and click Finish. 
4. Enter your username in the format ED\username and put in your University password. 
5. Select Remember my credentials and press OK. 

### Sciquest - buying lab stuff and computer stuff

If you're going to be ordering things (computer equipment, lab reagents etc.), sign up for [sciquest, instructions here](https://www.edweb.ed.ac.uk/procurement/eprocurement/sciquest). Graham and Davey at Roger Land Stores handle sciquest access for SBS.

### Expenses

For expenses (e.g. conferences, outreach, travel) you need to have an account on [eExpenses system](https://www.ed.ac.uk/finance/finance-training-hub/finance-systems/eexpenses).

This is due to be replaced by the [People and Money system](https://uoe.sharepoint.com/sites/ServiceExcellenceProgramme/SitePages/Core-Systems-Frequently-Asked-Questions.aspx?CT=1600244032049&OR=OWA-NT&CID=db9141e8-712e-8971-05aa-882e91124b82) in April 2021. So don't rush to sign up.

### RSpace - Electronic lab notebook

[Rspace](http://rspace.is.ed.ac.uk/) - this is the electronic lab notebook that is used by everyone who works in the wet lab. 

To get an account, email [data.support@ed.ac.uk](mailto:data.support@ed.ac.uk) and cc Edward, subject: Add user to Wallace lab Rspace, and include your UUN.

Subsequent logins go through EASE. 

There is a lot of help available, e.g. [new user tutorial](https://rspace.is.ed.ac.uk/workspace?simpo-walkthrough=2ba644dacb96d081dea670fdd06620dc), [RSpace helpdocs](https://researchspace.helpdocs.io/).

We have [guidelines for how to write lab notebook entries to go in the lab manual](), feel free to discuss with others in the lab too.

#### Linking RSpace to datastore

Please link your datastore to RSpace as well. You can set this up by following this Youtube video: [Linking RSpace ELN to Datastore at University of Edinburgh](https://rb.gy/kdx05n). 

Please note that if the SSH key registration does not work properly the first time, click the hyperlink under your login name in the main panel of RSpace to reregister the key.
Then, navigate to the Wallace lab data store - `csce_datastore_biology_groups_wallace_rna_data`. 
From here, choose the files/folders you would like to add. 
They will be shown in your lab book page wherever you have placed the link. To download the files - click on the filename in the lab book page, click the "i" button that pops up underneath and then click download.

### protocols.io - protocol sharing

We use [protocols.io](https://www.protocols.io/) to write, share, edit protocols. It's a great site! Create an account with your @ed.ac.uk email address. Ask to join the [Wallace lab for Fungal RNA group](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/wallace-lab-for-fungal-rna).

protocols.io integrates with RSpace and also with slack. This means that you can link your lab notebook page to the protocol you used, discuss a protocol with the rest of us, and so on. 

protocols.io, like RSpace, is a service that we pay for access to via an institutional subscription. Don't be embarrassed to ask for help, we are paying for that service.

### Eddie - high performance compute server

For really big analysis needs, we tend to use [Eddie from ecdf](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/research-support/research-computing/ecdf/high-performance-computing). They have all the power you need, helpful tutorials, etc.

Often it is helpful to run medium-sized jobs on [bifx](http://bifx-core.bio.ed.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/Main_Page), the server at the Wellcome Centre for Cell Biology. Ask Edward about this. 


### ORCID

[ORCID](https://orcid.org/) provides a persistent digital identifier (an ORCID iD) that you own and control, and that distinguishes you from every other researcher. Set one up, it will be useful.

### git, github, gitlab

We use git extensively as version control software, to share data and code within the lab and across the world. Even the lab website is hosted on [github](http://github.com/). Please create a github account. Then, create your team page on the lab website as [described in the README.md](https://github.com/ewallace/ewallace.github.io).

The University also has something similar, [a private instance of gitlab](https://git.ecdf.ed.ac.uk/), which we sometimes use, and which uses the UUN/EASE login.

## Email lists to join

Edinburgh manages mailing lists through [the mlist server](https://mlist.is.ed.ac.uk/lists).

Please join:

* `synthsys-all` - the synthsys centre email list.
* `synthsys-lab` - people who use synthsys lab space (if doing *wet* lab work in Waddington building)
* `waddington_occupants` - anyone who occupies any space in the Waddington building.
* `icmb` - the institute for cell biology, etc.

To join these, it is often easiest to email Julie Fyffe, [synthsys](http://www.synthsys.ed.ac.uk/) administrator, and cc Edward.

Depending on your interests, you may also wish to join:

* Edinburgh Infectious Diseases mailing list - email [Hilary Snaith, EID administrator](eid@ed.ac.uk)

## Software to install on your local computer

* R: https://cran.rstudio.com/ 
* Rstudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 
* tidyverse R packages: https://www.tidyverse.org/
* Python: the cool kids install this with [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) nowadays
* Snapgene: https://www.snapgene.com/ - SynthSys has a licence
* Inkscape: https://inkscape.org/
* Zoom: [use the university's service](https://www.ed.ac.uk/information-services/computing/comms-and-collab/zoom)
* Surely there must be some others?

If you are a new start and you don't have an adequate laptop for your work, talk to Edward, and we will find a way to fix that. The program or school funds laptops for all new PhD students.

# Wet lab

There's a number of accounts and setup tasks relevant to getting going in the wet lab. Safety comes first, although here it's listed after.

## Wet lab - Android tablet

We have Android tablet computers that live in the lab that you can use to take notes, take pictures of experiments and upload them directly to your lab notebook by RSpace. Use this! First you will need to set up an account on the tablet kept in your bay.

There is also a windows tablet used to control the lab microscope (does that have accounts???)

## Wet lab - synthsys scheduler

For use of many items of lab equipment - plate readers, fragment analyser, qPCR machine, and so on - you need an account on [the synthsys scheduler](http://synthsys.bio.ed.ac.uk/biosched/index.php). The page is accessible from campus or the VPN. 

Plate readers tend to be in high demand, join the plate readers mailing list (how??). You may have to join the weekly "plate reader" booking meeting if you are going to use them regularly. 

## Wet lab - DNA sequencing

Sign up for a DNA sequencing account at [MRC PPU in Dundee](https://www.dnaseq.co.uk/). We use them for routine Sanger sequencing of constructs. Wallace lab code is 2248, and the lab address as the invoice address.

## Wet lab - facilities

For fancy fluorescence microscopy, the [Centre Optical Instrumentation Laboratory (COIL)](http://coil.bio.ed.ac.uk/) is a Wellcome Trust funded facility containing the most up to date imaging equipment. COIL also has a scheduler that you need to sign up for to use.

The school has [other facilities with great specialised equipment](https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology/research/facilities). Genomics, proteomics, etc.

## Wet lab - other considerations (incomplete)

* opentrons pipetting robot
* centrifuges
* we have a tube labeling machine
* we have a lot of equipment, but lack a single list of all the stuff we have. Ask people!

<a name="safety"></a>

# Safety

We take safety seriously. If anyone were to be careless, there would be a number of ways to damage yourself or other people involving chemicals, explosions, and opportunistic pathogens. We *must* follow the [health and safety guidance from the  School as described in SBS wiki](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/SBSIntranet/Health+and+Safety). We also need to learn about the risks, how big they are, how to avoid them, and generally how to take care.

Some examples of genuinely dangerous things that affect our work:

* Fungal pathogens such as _Cryptococcus_ are dangerous to immunocompromised or pregnant people.
* It's 2021, and we are still in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic.
* Microwaves heating liquids can cause scalding, or if containers are sealed can cause explosions that can cause serious damage.
* Reagents for lysis and extraction, such as betamercaptoethanol, phenol, and trizol, melt flesh and cause burns. In large quantities they are lethal.
* You can set your hair on fire with a bunsen burner.

All these things can be low risk if thought about carefully. Know the risks and know the preventative measures. Discuss these with your colleages and with Edward.

If you notice anyone doing anything dangerous or risky, talk to them and talk to Edward.


## Training

The Health and Safety Induction and the Buildings Induction are now on [Learn](https://www.learn.ed.ac.uk/). It can be a bit difficult to find things on Learn, the H & S one can be found by searching the course catalogue for “safety induction” and choosing the relevant one (e.g. PhD) and the buildings one by searching “SBS Buildings Induction”.

Once you have completed the buildings induction you should contact the building manager, who will send some building-specific info as well. Someone in the group should do a tour of the building with a view to fire safety, pointing out:

* Fire alarm activation points nearest the lab/office
* Fire escape routes and exits
* First aid kits, first aid room and how to contact a first aider
* The day and time of the fire alarm test

## Risk assessments

In lab Waddington 2.18 we have a folder of risk assessments covering procedures. These should all be looked over. Those that affect your work must be read, understood, and signed, before you will be allowed to work in the lab. If there are any errors or omissions in the risk assessments, please alert Rosey and Edward immediately.

## Liquid nitrogen

The university has special training measures for Liquid Nitrogen, following a few nasty accidents. To sign up, get a code and information by emailing [SBS safety](mailto:sbsafety@ed.ac.uk), and cc Edward, with subject line "sign up for liquid nitrogen training".

<a name="edward_checklist"></a>

# Edward's Checklist

* Request building access
* Invite to Slack
* Invite to lab calendar
* Request RSpace access
* [Invite to protocols.io Wallace Lab for Fungal RNA](https://www.protocols.io/workspaces/wallace-lab-for-fungal-rna/manage?tab=members)

<a name="fix_things"></a>

# Fix missing things

Is there something that you needed to know that wasn't covered here? Ask the lab on slack. Ask other people until you get an answer. 

Then [edit it on the website github](https://github.com/ewallace/ewallace.github.io/blob/master/manual/_posts/2020-09-07-newstart.md), so that the next person who needs it can benefit too.
