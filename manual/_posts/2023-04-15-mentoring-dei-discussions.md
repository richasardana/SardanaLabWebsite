As scientists we need to think rigorously and creatively about our science, but we also perform our science in a social context. Including conversations about topics of MEDEI (Mentoring, Ethics, Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) in our group discussions is meaningful for our growth as individuals and scientists.
In order to make room for such conversations, we assign one person who picks up a MEDEI topic for discussion during our journal club meetings. We discuss the MEDEI topic for the first 15-20 min before we begin reading the assigned journal club paper.
The objective of these discussions is not to have political debates but to create a space where we have sensitivity to the social climate around us.
