# Shared jobs in the lab

To ensure that the lab runs smoothly, specific tasks will be assigned to specific people. 
These jobs are necessary to ensure the lab runs smoothly. Most jobs are allocated to more than one person to ensure that jobs are done if someone is away.
If you are going to be away or cannot do your lab job for any non-emergency reason, please plan ahead and ask someone else to fill in.
Conversely, please be ready to help others when asked, when reasonably possible.

<!-- More details on individual jobs are given in the notes, below the table.

## Notes

### Inventory and ordering

Everyone is responsible for keeping track of lab stocks of consumables and updating the inventory. No-one wants to interrupt an experiment because stocks of some reagent or consumable are low. Plan ahead and order reagents and consumables ahead of time. 

### Looking after an instrument 

This usually involves:

* being familiar with the user manual and its location
* ensuring that the machine is clean and functional
* checking on maintenance requirements
* training new users
* keeping an eye on use, e.g. users acting erroneously or not cleaning up after themselves. 
* communicating about problems


### Preparing Communal Lab Buffer Stocks

In general, a rule of thumb is if you are using a solution, and it is running low, make more. You can find the recipes in the lab protocols. If you don't know how, ask people. Be a good lab citizen, others will thank you for it. If a chemical is running low, put in a order request asap.


### Glassware and plasticware

Wash the glassware after use, then rinse with dI water, and dry on the dish rack or cart. Culture flasks will be capped and autoclaved for reuse. 

# Lab cleanup

Every 6 months we will organize a lab cleanup, in which everyone is expected to participate.

Lab cleanups include:

* incubators
* centrifuge
* fridges
* throwing out old solutions, media, plates
* clean up personal spaces
* change absorbant pads in areas that routinely get wet, such as, the electrophoresis bench.
* updating the lab organization
