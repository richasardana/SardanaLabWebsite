# Lab meetings for everyone (weekly)

Lab meetings are the regular opportunity for the whole group to come together to talk about science, and about important logistics.
Lab meetings are a mutually respectful and supportive environment.

Lab meetings can take various formats:

* Research update - led by a single lab member, is most common
* One-slide meeting -  everyone presents one slide on their recent work
* Journal clubs - one or more lab members lead discussion of a relevant paper
* Other - for example, a "welcome back" meeting, a "write some of the lab manual" meeting, a "state of the lab" annual-ish meeting

Whatever the format, the goal of lab meeting is for everyone in the room, including the presenter, to learn things that are useful to their work.


## Giving a Research update lab meeting

The purpose of these lab meetings is to communicate and to exchange useful ideas, not to simply "update", nor to impress. These are also your opportunities to hone your presentation skills, so take advantage of it. 
This will usually be a talk with slides, with sub-goals:

* Teach the group about your work. Make it accessible to everyone. Give a good, thoughtful introduction so everyone understands the why, what, and how.
* Articulate what you are thinking about your work's status and future.
* Solicit feedback and ideas from other lab members, to improve your project(s).
* Practice for talks outside the lab, in a friendly environment.

Research update presentations should usually:

* Give an introduction to your project, highlighting important ideas and objectives.
* Give each slide a helpful title, ideally a sentence that describes its content.
* Explain how to interpret each kind of data that you present, concisely and clearly. All data and axes need readable labels.
* Include a small number of crucial ideas/results from elsewhere, appropriately referenced.
* Make it clear when the talk shifts to your results; present selected primary data.
* Address problems, uncertainties, and obstacles.
* End with some kind of conclusion and plan for future work.

A well-thought-out lab meeting will strengthen your future work, by enabling a productive conversation with the group about your ideas and plans. It is the responsibility of everyone else in the lab meeting to engage with the presenter and the presentation.
Everyone is encouraged to ask questions. Naive and basic questions are encouraged. We are not here to judge, but to be curious and to learn. We all bring value to lab meetings, and for each of us there are very many things we don't know; if one person has a question, it's likely other people have the same question.

## One-slide meetings

In brief, everyone presents one slide or one printed page on their recent work. Guidelines:

* The slide is an opportunity for scientific feedback and discussion on your work.
* You could present a result (a gel, a figure, an analysis, etc)
* You could present the design for a future or in-progress experiment
* You could present a cartoon or schematic figure to explain a mental model you're working with
* The slide should have a title that is a sentence summarizing the message of the slide
* 5 minutes is not a lot of time to explain lots of things. There is probably only time for one panel of a figure, or a small cartoon schematic followed by a result.
* We don’t care how much you have done (everyone knows you have done a lot) - we all want 5 minutes of interesting scientific discussion.

Claus Wilke’s blogpost, [share your preliminary work with other people](https://serialmentor.com/blog/2014/7/8/share-your-preliminary-work-with-other-people-even-if-you-think-its-crap), gives an eloquent perspective.


# Journal club meetings 

Roughly they work like:

* We choose a relevant paper, that everyone should try to read before the meeting. Come prepared to talk about what you learned from the paper and any questions you have.
* The paper can be old, new, or a preprint. The big criteria for choice is that it has to be valuable for us to discuss as a group. Maybe it's the ideas, maybe the methods, maybe the subject matter.
* Discussion is usually led by one person, and/or can be shared around the group. We don't need perfect presentations, just some structure for a good discussion.
* It is usually helpful to start with some context about why the paper was written and why you chose the paper / why it's relevant to us.
* The leader is encouraged to showcase their own data/project or other related information in the light of the main journal club paper. These have been some of the most useful journal club moments.
* Everyone suggests papers for next subgroup meeting, and we decide on one of them. It is ok to suggest a paper that you have already read. 
* Another possibility is to discuss journal club papers in themed subgroups. 


# 1-1 meetings 

Most lab members have 1-1 meetings with the PI, fortnightly. Use these meetings well to get the best feedback and guidance you can receive to make your research more productive, and build a relationship with you PI. Some guidelines:

* The lab member takes notes and sends a summary to PI later on the day of the 1-1 meeting. Notes should begin "1-1 meeting notes [date]". 
* Meeting starts by discussing progress on agreed priorities and action points from previous meeting.
* Meeting includes reviewing lab notebook, or other data/analysis/writing/slides, as appropriate.
* Meeting ends by agreeing priorities for the lab member for their next fortnight, which go in the notes. Realistically, there will be between 1 and 3 priorities for the next two-week period, because larger numbers of things cannot all be prioritized.
* Notes should include action points for PI (with deadlines), and any questions arising from the meeting that we don't yet have answers to.
* Notes can be brief; whatever can be written up in 15 minutes is good enough.

Why bother with these guidelines and with writing notes?

* Guidelines are a [checklist](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/) to make sure we cover the important points.
* Notes act as a "diary" of what we did, which makes it easier.
* It's pretty easy to misunderstand each other. Written notes help to clear up those misunderstandings, and especially to clarify what is and is not a priority.

Project students should find these guidelines useful to make the most of their meetings with the PI and any co-supervisors, although the meetings may have a different frequency or format.


# Lab socials

We will plan to do lab socials together as a group often. Everyone is requested to take initiative and suggest these events and help with making them materialize. Be inclusive. These are occasions to get to know your lab mates better, develop relationships, celebrate successes, milestones, and birthdays.
