*Questions/gaps addressed:* 

- Accurate protein complex formation (common examples of  dimerization through Zinc-fingers, BTB domains or leucine zippers) is important for the transcriptional programs that specify cell fate. How are the dynamics of these interactions accomplished?

- Transcription factors of the BTB family co-translationally form homodimers that are very stable. Transcription factors also contain activation domains that are rich in IDRs that allow recruitment of many proteins and nucleate transcription hubs which stimulate gene expression and controls cell fate decisions. How do cells establish the proper composition and dynamics of intricate transcription hubs?

*Major hypotheses:*

- 

*Key methods:* Accurate complex formation is particularly important for the transcriptional programs that specify cell fate.

-  

*Major takeaways:*
