## Sardana lab website is up and running!  

Can't wait to get the science started!

The site was generated using [Jekyll][1] Bootstrap and borrows its template from the [Drummond lab webpage]. The siteâ€™s source code is freely available on [GitHub][2]. Drummond lab site was in turn heavily influenced and templated on [Bedford lab's webpage].
