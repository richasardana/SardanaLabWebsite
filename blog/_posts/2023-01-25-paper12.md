*Questions/gaps addressed:* 

-  Aggressive growth of cancerous cells means dependence on teh environment for supplies of non-essential amino acids. This includes an increase in the rate of nutrient uptake, by upregulation of SLC transporters and a rewiring of intracellular metabolism.

- Which SLC transporters are more important for tumor growth, and can they used as therapeutic targets.

*Major hypotheses:*

- Key SLC and ABC transporters play an essential role in proliferation of cancerous cells.

*Key methods:* 

- CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) and activation (CRISPRa) growth-based pooled screens (10 sgRNAs/gene and 730 non-targeting controls) to systematically interrogate the individual contributions to nutrient transport and growth by 489 annotated members of the SLC and ABC transporters in human cells.

- Mass spectrometry-based transport assays to follow amino acid transport at the plasma membrane.

- Identified all amino acids in RPMI-1640 medium whose absence limited K562 cell proliferation by performing proliferation assays with a series of single amino acid dropout RPMI media to which amino acids were added back to between 0.1% and 100% of their normal levels. 

- Performed pooled CRISPRi/a screens at amino acid concentrations that reduced K562 cell proliferation by 50% for all 13 growth-limiting amino acids to identify transporter perturbations that caused either a decrease or increase in proliferation. Three rounds of low amino acid exposure lasting for four days with daily media changes followed by one recovery day in complete medium, Enrichment analysis between starved and complete RPMI conditions. 

*Major takeaways:*

- Removal of Asn, Asp, Glu, Gly, and Pro from the medium has no effect on the proliferation of K562 cells. Cystine deprivation induces significant cell death. 

- CRISPRi/a combination screens also allow identification of genes expressed in a particular cell line.
