*A paper a day- paper 2:*

*Questions/gaps addressed:* 

- Selection-cassette based genetic engineering (aka Longtine strategy) is a routine in yeast- are there negative consequences associated with this approach?

- Do selection-mediated editing strategies in yeast lead to transcriptional interference by long undecoded transcript isoforms (LUTIs) of neighboring genes (neighboring gene effect or NGE)? How can this effect be avoided?

*Major hypotheses:*

- Insertion of expression cassettes commonly used edit the genomes of yeast cells, can induce the repression of neighboring genes though synthetic and constitutive LUTI-based repression

*Key methods:* 

- Ribosome profiling and mRNA-sequencing (mRNA-seq)

- Label-free mass spec on fractionated polysomes and hierarchical clustering to assess global differences in polysome composition

- Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′RACE)

*Major takeaways:*

- Stable cassette-driven divergent transcripts (in most selection marker cassettes TRP1/Kan/Hyg/Nat) were detected in more than 30% of cassette-inserted loci

- Bidirectional promoter activity from the TEF promoter most likely cause of LUTI-based repression​

- Bidirectional promoters are very common, including pTEF in yeast, and the CMV, eEF1α, and SV40 promoters in mammalian systems

- Rrp6/exosome-mediated degradation can mask the divergent transcripts produced from cassette insertion in many cases​

- Placement of strong transcription terminator sequences flanking both ends of the resistance cassette prevents neighboring gene disruption​, provide modified Longtine based cassettes with these changes.
