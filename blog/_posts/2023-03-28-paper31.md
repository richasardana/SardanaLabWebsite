*Questions/gaps addressed:* 

- Two types of endosomal compartment in yeast: an early endosome-like compartment containing Rab5 (Vps21p) and a late endosome-like compartment containing Rab7. What is the identity of the Vps21p-residing compartment and how is the compartment is generated?

- GGAs and AP-1 form two distinct clathrin-coated vesicles, the GGA-enriched vesicle, including Ent3 and a minor population of Ent5, and the AP-1-enriched vesicle, which includes most of Ent5 and resides at the late TGN. 

- Activation of yeast Vps21 (Rab5) is partially suppressed by deletion of the epsin-like proteins, Ent3p/5p. 

- What are the functional relationships between clathrin adaptors in the Rab5 activation in yeast

*Major hypotheses:*

- 

*Key methods:* 

- GGA vesicles are formed approximately 10 s prior to the AP-1 vesicles, and GGA vesicles mediate the transport of cargos from the TGN to the vacuole. AP-1 vesicles mediate intra-Golgi recycling. 


*Major takeaways:*

-
