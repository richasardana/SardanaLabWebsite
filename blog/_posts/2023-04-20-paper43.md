*Questions/gaps addressed:* 

- Cystinosis is a rare autosomal recessive LSD, caused by mutations in the CTNS gene. The kidney is the first organ affected functionally. The most severe form is nephropathic/infantile cystinosis, resulting in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by 10 years of age. What is the mechanism of defects in renual tubular cells, are these due to functions besides cystine transport?

*Major hypothesis:*

- Defective lysosomal clearance may be a pivotal cause of the altered function of renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTECs). 

*Key methods:* 

- whole-genome microarray transcriptional expression profiles in RPTECs (isolated from patient urine samples) and fibroblasts (isolated from the same patient skin biopsies) from patients with cystinosis and healthy age- and gender-matched controls. 


*Major takeaways:*

- vATPase subunits levels are affected in CTNS KO
